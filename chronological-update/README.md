# Chronological Update

## 12/07/22 12:04PM
- Corporate is in the process of finalizing payroll.  They will process the checks at corporate and UPS NDA the live checks to our facility.  At the moment, it looks like all checks will be live ( no direct deposits ).
- Continue to run production
  - Keep filling out material & routing sheets
- Steve Osterloh ( VP of marketing ) will provide share folders we can give to customers who need to email files.  The files will be accessible by us at the plant through a web based program.  <br>
`TODO: ADD ARTWORK FILE SHARE ADDRESS HERE`
- Steve Osterloh will create temporary email addresses for each plant that can be given to customers.  These will not forward our existing emails, but will be for emergencies. The email will be web based as well.<br />
`TODO: ADD TEMPORARY EMAIL ADDRESS HERE`
- We expect emails being sent from Friday 12/2 until now to be delivered once the email server is brought back up.
- Ennis is going to send out an email response to all of our customer's emails they have on file with a statement, and the newly created temporary email address.
- There were at least 79 attacks nationwide from this threat.
- Non-infected computers are still good to use.
- Infected computers will need [these steps](../infected-instructions/README.md) performed prior to use by John K. or myself.
- Once Symantec is updated on each machine, the threat of reinfection is gone.

- Yes corporate's servers were affected. The latest update from corporate states:<br>
*On Friday we experienced some locked files on certain servers and desktops. These outages required us to recover from backups for some of our systems. Recovery from backups is currently taking place and as systems become available they will be accessible by our plants and customers.*
- Yes we can ship product out of both buildings. We currently have access to ship via UPS worldship and Unishippers but do not have JDE integration.

## 12/04/22 04:31PM
- After talking with corporate, we cannot implement our fix to get the shipping computers up and running. Until you hear differently from John or I, we won't be able to ship.

## 12/04/22 09:42AM
- Yes, the two shipping computers have been tested and are working.

## 12/04/22 07:00AM
- At the moment the phones do not work, but John Kilcoyne and I are working on restoring these.
- Yes, corporate's servers are affected.
- Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell at this time how long this will last. Our best guess is this will not be fixed by the week of 12/4 - 12/10 and could last as long as a month.
- We intend to have the two shipping computers operational so we can ship product. They will be able to access UPS, FedEx and Unishippers.
- The main fax line appears to be working.
- Some user's PCs were definitely infected causing the files to be encrypted and will be lost. We have not inspected every machine yet to determine the extent of this. The files on the server (Public, Users, etc.) appear to be safe and were backed up. The files in prepress have not been inspected yet, but are backed up weekly so the worst case scenario should be a loss of one week of files.
- At the moment we do not have access to email. Corporate's latest update states:<br>
*The Ennis email system has not been compromised and customers can feel confident in the emails that we send them.*
