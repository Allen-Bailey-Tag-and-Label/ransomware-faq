## Do the phones work?
At the moment the phones do not work, but John Kilcoyne and I are working on restoring these.

## Is corporate affected?
Yes, corporate's servers are affected.

## How long do we expect this to last?
Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell at this time how long this will last.  Our best guess is this will not be fixed by the week of 12/4 - 12/10 and could last as long as a month.
