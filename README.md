## Do the phones work?
12/04/22 09:07AM: The phones appear to be up and working for external and internal.

~~At the moment the phones do not work, but John Kilcoyne and I are working on restoring these.~~

## Is corporate affected?
12/06/22 08:44PM: Yes corporate's servers were affected.  The latest update from corporate states:<br />
*On Friday we experienced some locked files on certain servers and desktops.  These outages required us to recover from backups for some of our systems.  Recovery from backups is currently taking place and as systems become available they will be accessible by our plants and customers.*

~~Yes, corporate's servers are affected.~~

## How long do we expect this to last?
12/04/22 04:35PM: Corporate has made progress on the servers in Texas.  We expect to have an update tomorrow (Monday 12/5), possibly in the morning.

~~Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell at this time how long this will last.  Our best guess is this will not be fixed by the week of 12/4 - 12/10 and could last as long as a month.~~

## Can we ship product?
12/06/22 08:44PM: Yes we can ship product out of both buildings.  We currently have access to ship via UPS worldship and Unishippers but do not have JDE integration.

~~12/04/22 04:31PM: After talking with corporate, we cannot implement our fix to get the shipping computers up and running.  Until you hear differently from John or I, we won't be able to ship.~~

~~12/04/22 09:42AM: Yes, the two shipping computers have been tested and are working.~~

~~We intend to have the two shipping computers operational so we can ship product.  They will be able to access UPS, FedEx and Unishippers.~~

## Do the faxes work?
The main fax line appears to be working.

## Are my files affected?
Some user's PCs were definitely infected causing the files to be encrypted and will be lost.  We have not inspected every machine yet to determine the extent of this.  The files on the server (Public, Users, etc.) appear to be safe and were backed up.  The files in prepress have not been inspected yet, but are backed up weekly so the worst case scenario should be a loss of one week of files.

## What is the state of email?
At the moment we do not have access to email.  Corporate's latest update states:<br />
*The Ennis email system has not been compromised and customers can feel confident in the emails that we send them.*

## What should I do if my computer is infected?
At the moment, the computer should stay disconnected from the internet.  John or myself will perform the fix once we receive direction from corporate.  The instructions for the fix will reside at [instructions](/infected-instructions/README.md).
