## Do the phones work?
12/04/22 09:07AM: The phones appear to be up and working for external and internal.

~~At the moment the phones do not work, but John Kilcoyne and I are working on restoring these.~~

## Is corporate affected?
Yes, corporate's servers are affected.

## How long do we expect this to last?
12/04/22 04:35PM: Corporate has made progress on the servers in Texas.  We expect to have an update tomorrow (Monday 12/5), possibly in the morning.

~~Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell at this time how long this will last.  Our best guess is this will not be fixed by the week of 12/4 - 12/10 and could last as long as a month.~~

## Can we ship product?
12/4/22 04:31PM: After talking with corporate, we cannot implement our fix to get the shipping computers up and running.  Until you hear differently from John or I, we won't be able to ship.

~~12/4/22 09:42AM: Yes, the two shipping computers have been tested and are working.~~

~~We intend to have the two shipping computers operational so we can ship product.  They will be able to access UPS, FedEx and Unishippers.~~

## Do the faxes work?
The main fax line appears to be working.

## Are my files affected?
The files on the server (Public, Users, etc.) appear to be safe and were backed up.  The files in prepress have not been inspected yet, but are backed up weekly so the worst case scenario should be a loss of one week of files.
