## Do the phones work?
The phones are up and working for external and internal.

## Is corporate affected?
Yes corporate's servers were affected.  The latest update from corporate states:

*On Friday we experienced some locked files on certain servers and desktops.  These outages required us to recover from backups for some of our systems.  Recovery from backups is currently taking place and as systems become available they will be accessible by our plants and customers.*

With that being said, there is no evidence any files were taken or lost from the corporate servers.

See Ennis' response sent to our customers [here](/ennis-response/README.md).

## How long do we expect this to last?
Corporate has made progress on the servers in Texas.  At the moment JDE is operational at corporate, and they are working on restoring email and AES.

## Can we ship product?
Yes we can ship product out of both buildings.  We currently have access to ship via UPS worldship and Unishippers but do not have JDE integration.

## Do the faxes work?
The fax line ( 585-538-3063 ) is currently work.

## Are my files affected?
Some user's PCs were definitely infected causing the files to be encrypted and will be lost.  We have not inspected every machine yet to determine the extent of this.  The files on the server (Public, Users, etc.) appear to be safe and were backed up.  The files in prepress are also safe and not lost or ecrypted.

## What is the state of email?
At the moment we do not have access to our regular email.  Corporate's latest update states:

*The Ennis email system has not been compromised and customers can feel confident in the emails that we send them.*

We have been provided with a temporary email address ( [abtl@ennisonline.com](mailto:abtl@ennisonline.com) ).  Our customers have also been sent an email with Ennis' response and this email to notify them.

## What should I do if my computer is infected?
At the moment, the computer should stay disconnected from the internet.  John or myself will perform the fix once we receive direction from corporate.  The instructions for the fix will reside at [instructions](/infected-instructions/README.md).

## Will payroll process on time?
Corporate has assured me they are working on payroll and expect it to go out accordingly.  At the moment it looks like the checks will be cut at corporate and NDA to the facilities.  All checks may be live as oppossed to direct deposits, but I will update this when I get clarification.
