# Temp Email

Corporate has sent out an [email response](../ennis-response/README.md) to all of our customers they have an email file for.  In the email, they have provided a temporary email ( [abtl@ennisonline.com](mailto:abtl@ennisoneline.com) ) for the customer to use until the regular email server is restored.  We plan on getting this setup on all CSR computers that are not infected so we can respond to our customers.

See this link for [outlook setup instructions](./outlook-setup-instructions/README.md).

Since we will all have this, we'll need to triage the emails as they come in.  The proper procedure is:

1. Determine if the email is directed towards you, or if you feel you can respond to the request.
2. If so, move the email out of the inbox, into a folder in your archives / local PST.  This will remove it from the server, and prevent multiple people from responding.
3. You can use the following copy for a generic response and modify as needed:

*I apologize for the delay in getting back to you with your request.  As you read, we have have experienced network difficulties and unable to access emails.  Until our services are up, we will not be able to provide you with updated pricing.*
  
*With that being said, as soon as we are back up and operational, we will expedite your request below and get back with you as soon as possible.  Thank you for your understanding and if you need anything else, feel free to give me a call.*
