# Slow Outlook Fix

Luke shared with us steps to fix outlook when/if it is slow. You essentially close outlook and reopen it. You can verify if it is going to be slow by doing the following steps:

1. `Left-Click` the `Up-Arrow` in the bottom of your windows bar to show hidden icons
2. Holding `Control`, `Right-Click` on `Outlook` to see additional options
3. Click the option `Connection Status...`
4. If any of the `Server Names` do not start with `https://esrv12` then you will have connection issues.
5. You should close outlook and reopen and start again at step #1.
