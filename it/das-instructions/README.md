# DAS Instructions

To connect to DAS, I used `Microsoft Edge`. I'm not sure if Chrome works, as it didn't previously. The link to it is [http://das.ennis.com/dasweb/](http://das.ennis.com/dasweb/). The settings are:

| Field       | Value               |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| User        | `your JDE user`     |
| Password    | `your JDE password` |
| Environment | `PD920`             |
| Role        | `*All`              |
